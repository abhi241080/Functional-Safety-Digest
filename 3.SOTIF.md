2. Safety Of The Intended Functionality (SOTIF)
2.1. Introduction
For certain systems that rely on sensing the external or internal environment, there may be potential hazardous behavior arising from the system's intended function or performance limitations. This category of failure is not addressed by the ISO 26262 series. Examples of such limitations include:
The function's inability to correctly understand road conditions and operate safely; this also includes functions that use machine learning algorithms.
Insufficient robustness of the function relative to changes in sensor input or different environmental conditions.


Safety Of The Intended Functionality (SOTIF): The absence of unreasonable risk due to these potentially hazardous behaviors related to such limitations. Functional Safety (addressed by the ISO 26262 series) and SOTIF are distinct yet complementary aspects of safety.

Table 1 illustrates how the possible causes of hazardous events map to the existing standards.

The figure below provides a schematic illustration of how these two standards correspond to hardware and software development.

2.2. Scope
SOTIF Definition: The absence of unreasonable risk due to hazards resulting from functional insufficiencies of the intended functionality or by reasonably foreseeable misuse by persons is referred to as the Safety Of The Intended Functionality (SOTIF).

ISO 21448 provides guidance on the applicable design, verification, and validation (V&V) measures required to achieve SOTIF. ISO 21448 is not applicable to malfunctions covered by the ISO 26262 series or hazards directly caused by the system's technology (e.g., eye damage caused by laser sensors).

ISO 21448 is intended to be applied to intended functionalities where appropriate situational awareness is crucial for safety and where that situational awareness is derived from complex sensors and processing algorithms. This is especially relevant for Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) and emergency intervention systems (e.g., emergency braking systems) that have Level 1 and Level 2 automation metrics based on the OICA/SAE standard J3016. This version of the document may be considered for higher levels of automated operation, but additional measures might be required.

This document is not applicable to existing system functions that had recognized and trusted design, V&V measures at the time of publication (e.g., Dynamic Stability Control (DSC) systems, airbags, etc.). If situational awareness derived from complex sensors and processing algorithms is part of an innovation, some of the measures described in ISO 21448 are applicable to the innovative functions of such systems.

In identifying hazardous events, intentional use and reasonably foreseeable misuse are combined with potentially hazardous system behavior.

Reasonably foreseeable misuse may directly lead to potentially hazardous system behavior and is also considered a possible event that may directly trigger SOTIF-related hazardous events.

Deliberate alteration of system operation is considered functional abuse. Functional abuse is outside the scope of ISO 21448.

2.3. Summary
In ISO 21448, scenarios relevant to a given use case are divided into four areas (see Figure 7).

Areas 1, 2, and 3 are used to construct the conceptual model for this document. Area 4 is referenced for completeness but is not needed for the purposes of ISO 21448 and is therefore not used further. When considering the areas in the model, it may be useful to visualize their size as representing the proportion of each type of scenario within that area.

A given use case can include both known and unknown scenarios.

Early in development, Areas 2 and 3 may be too large, leading to unacceptable residual risk. The ultimate goal of SOTIF activities is to evaluate SOTIF for Areas 2 and 3 and provide arguments that these areas are sufficiently small, such that the resulting residual risk is acceptable.

While the known scenarios in Area 2 and corresponding use cases can be explicitly evaluated,

The scenarios and corresponding use cases in Area 3 are evaluated through industry best practices or other methods (e.g., design measurements, system analysis, or dedicated experiments).

The results of these evaluations provide an argument that Area 3 is sufficiently small, Area 2 is managed through SOTIF improvements, and thus the probability of encountering these scenarios is adequately low.

It is expected that Area 2 and Area 3 will shrink, and Area 1 will grow during development (see Figure 8).

The SOTIF process objectives concerning Area 1, Area 2, and Area 3, and their related scenarios are:

Area 1: Maximize or maintain the area while minimizing Area 2 and 3. This preserves or improves the safety function.

Area 2: Reduce the area of technical measures to an acceptable, smaller level, where statistical significance is commensurate with the relative impact of the technical measures; evaluate potential risks and, if necessary, shift hazardous scenarios to Area 1 by improving the function or limiting its usage/performance.

Area 3: Minimize the area (unknown risks) with minimal effort where possible (every detected hazardous scenario is moved to Area 2).

Figure 9 describes the flowchart used to improve the intended functionality to ensure its safety. The circled numbers indicate the corresponding clauses in this document.
