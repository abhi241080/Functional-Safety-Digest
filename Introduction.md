Overview
This document represents a compilation of notes and summaries gathered from an extensive review of materials related to Functional Safety in Automotive Electronics, reliable design methodologies, and implementation strategies developed by various chip suppliers and vehicle Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs). It is presented as a technical reading Reference Material. For each topic and concept, I have aimed to use the most descriptive and explanatory presentation available, deliberately limiting personal interpretation . Should a deeper comprehension of any topic be desired, readers are encouraged to consult the reference document.

The structure of this document is as follows:

Initial Concepts: The document begins with an introduction to the fundamental concepts of ISO 26262 Functional Safety (Chapter 1), followed by the specific functional safety requirements for autonomous driving vehicles outlined in ISO 21448 (Chapter 2).

Design Challenges: We then discuss the diverse array of faults that must be addressed in modern automotive hardware and software designs (Chapter 3). To manage these faults, several common hardware and software design patterns for safety-critical embedded systems are introduced (Chapter 4).

Industry Solutions: Following this foundational overview, the document details the safety architectures employed by leading autonomous driving system manufacturers (Chapter 5) and reviews the built-in safety mechanisms of commonly used automotive-specific processors (Chapter 6).

Detailed Implementation: Building upon this knowledge, a detailed description of the safety solutions, along with their hardware and software implementation mechanisms, offered by Xilinx is provided (Chapter 7).

Analysis and Standards: The text then summarizes frequently used safety mechanisms (Chapter 8), introduces several analytical methodologies pertinent to ISO 26262 Functional Safety design (Chapter 9), and concludes with a concise overview of the functional safety mechanisms provided by AUTOSAR (Chapter 10).
